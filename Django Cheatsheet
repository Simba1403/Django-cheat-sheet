
# What is Django?

So Django is a python based well structured framework that allow us to build complex web applications. It use MVT model that effortlessly allow us to make complex applications.

----------
# What are the features of Django?
Support ORM
Web templating system
Middleware class support
Built in Admin interface
Easy inheritance
Several in-built security features and mitigations to protect web applications

-----
# What is a virtual environment
Virtual environment allow us to make separate dependencies to the different projects by creating isolated environments.
Creating a virtual environment is considered as a ideal practice, because it eliminates the dependencies and conflicts.
# What is MVT structure?

MVT stands for model view template, so basically it is the relationship between the 3 structures of the python based packages named models, views and templates, where model allow us to handle, and represent the database  table, and its attributes define the columns of the table. Model allow us to interact with the database without SQL queries.

Where views are the python packages that handles the user requests, interact with the models to fetch the data and return the response,  that allow us to showcase the data on our web application. They act as a bridge between the models and templates that transfer the data from model to template that show the data on our server.

Templates handle the presentation and are the UI that loads our dynamic data came from views and represent it on the server.

--------
# What does the makemigrations and migrate do?

makemigrations command used to create migration files for your models. it tell Django how to apply changes to your database schema based on changes made to your models.

whereas migrate make the changes done which are applied to our database.
it creates or updates the database tables
# What is a Django project?

So Django project is our main directory that contains the settings and the configurations for Django web application, it act as a framework that ties all the applications together.

# Django Application?

Django applications are the modular components within a project, each designed to handle the specific functionality and function.

There can be multiple applications in a Django project.

-------

# What are the components of the project and Applications.

Project consists of 

- Settings.py- settings.py is a python package that is the main file in our web applications that consists of all the settings and options that is used to build and control a web application such as database configuration, middleware, installed apps, template settings.
- urls.py - urls.py is responsible for routing HTTP request to the appropriate views in our app, it act as central URL configuration for our project.
	- what is a http request? http request is the message sent by a client to a server to ask for information or to perform an action. it is a fundamental part of how the web works.
	
- asgi.py - so asgi.py act as the entry point for our project when using the asgi servers(daphne, uvicorn). It tells the server how to load your django application.
	it is a successor of the wsgi.py where wsgi.py only handles the HTTP request , asgi.py is designed for both the asynchronous and synchronous communication.
		What are synchronous and asynchronous communication? the synchronous communication is where the  sender and receiver communicates at same time, and the sender need to wait for the receiver to respond.

		Whereas in asynchronous communication the sender and reciever need not to communicate at same time and sender can keep on working if receiver can't respond immediately.
	
- wsgi.py- The wsgi.py is responsible for serving the web appliction using the wsgi server like apache, it is the standard interface between web servers
- __init__.py- init.py is the python file used to mark a directory as a python package.


-------
# Apps components.

- views.py
- models.py
- admin.py- admin.py is used to load and register the models with the django admin interface. Django admin interface is a built in web application that allow us to manage our app data and perform the CRUD operations.
	- CRUD  operations are create, read, update, delete
- urls.py
- test.py- it is used to write the tests for our web application, tests are important to ensure the app behave as expected and to prevent the bugs in future.
- apps.py- it is automatically created when we start a new application, it contains the configuration class for the app. 

-------------------------
# What is Object relational Mapping?

In django ORM is the core feature that enable developer to perform the CRUD operations on the database tables in a pythonic way, it  allow us to interact with the database without writing SQL queries.

# What are the benefits of the ORM?

- Simplicity-  No need to write the orm queries manually, we can write the python syntax
- Database independence- It allow us to use the multiple databases making it easy to switch between them
- Security- prevents SQL injection attacks by safely escaping queries.
- Maintainability- Code is easier to read and maintain because written in the python.
- Rapid development- Perform the database queries without worrying about the raw sql syntax.

# What are forms ?

Django provide a flexible forms module that simplifies creating, validating, and processing forms, it is used to handle the user input such as collecting the data through HTML forms, validating it, and saving it to the database. 

--------
# Why to use Django forms instead of Html forms?

- Validation- Automatically validates input data.
- Reusable- forms can be reused across multiple views and templates.
- Security- Protects against common vulnerability like Cross site request forgery and cross site scripting.
- Integration- Easily integrates with the models and views.

# Types of the forms-

Django Forms-(forms.Form)
	Used for manually handling the fields and validation
	Not directly tied to a model.
Model Forms- (forms.ModelForm)
	Automatically linked to a model 
	Simplifies creating forms to interact with the model data

------------
# CSRF

it is a type of attack where malicious website tricks the user's browser into making unintended request to another website

It ensures that the POST request comes from a trusted source by using CSRF token
- A csrf token is a unique secret value which is generated for each user session.
- It checks if the tokens of the user match with the request, if not the request is cancelled.

--------
# What are sessions?

sessions keep track of the site's and browsers state. During the session the user data is stored in sessions which end once the user close the browser or logs out of the program.

-------
# What are static files?

Static files consists of the data other then text, that are mainly url, images, etc. it is used to load the static content in the templates.

-----
# What is a superuser?
Superuser is the most powerful user with the permission to create, read, delete and update on the admin page which includes the model records.

---
# What is jinja templating?

It is a modern templating engine for python, which is designed to create dynamic and reusable templates. Used to render the HTml pages dynamically.

------
# Explain the use of middlewares?

They are used to keep the application secure during the request and response state

--------

# What are django cookies?

Django cookies are a piece of information stored in the client's browser. To set and fetch cookies, django provides built-in methods to use the set_cookie() method for setting a cookie and the get() method for getting a cookie.

--------
# Explain user authentication in Django?

Django comes up with a built in authentication system configured by default to handle the Users, permissions, groups etc. 

It not only authenticate but also authorize them, the objects are:-
- Users
- Groups
- Permissions
- Password hashing system
- Forms validation
------
# What is a Django render function?

Render is a shortcut for passing a template and a data dictionary. It combines templates with a data dictionary using a templating engine.

-----
# What is a context in Django?
A context is a dictionary in which keys represent the variable names and the values reflect the values of those variable.


-----
# What are n+1 queries in django?

It is a common issue in ORM based systems like Django, it occurs when our code executes 1 query to fetch a parent object and then N additional queries for related objects.

It can be solved using select_related() - select_related() reduces the number of queries by joining tables in single query.


---------
# Django simple history

Django simple history is a Django package that helps us to track the changes made to our models over time. It works by storing all the changes in a separate table. This way we can see what is changed, when it is change and who made the change.

It is used to 
Track the changes
Audit logs
Restore old versions

-------
# Multiple database routing?

Django  allow us to use multiple database in same project. Instead of using just one default database, we can set up multiple databases and decide which one to use for read, write and query.

# Why?
Data separation- Separate user data, logs, or archived data into different database.
performance- Distribute the load
Integration- Use separate for legacy system and third-party integrations
Backup and scalability- Manage backups and scalability more easily.

---

# Management commands- 

Management commands in django are custom scripts that let us automate the tasks or add custom functionality that can be run using the manage.py command. 
these are similar to built-in commands but we can create our own to handle the specific usercase.

# Why to use?

- Automating tasks- Perform repetitive tasks like cleaning up the old data, sending emails, generating records, and updating them
- Custom functionality- Add features that don't fit into the usual views or models.

-------
# Logging in Django?

Logging in django is about tracking what is happening with our applications while it runs. For example, when a user visits our website, errors occur, or specific actions are performend.

Logging is a way to save the messages about our application's behavior.
These messages can be errors, warning, debug info, or general info.
help the developer to debug their app.

Common logging levels in django are:-
- Debug- For detailed information during the development
- Info- For general information about the app's operation
- Warning- To highlight something unusual
- Error- For serious issues that prevent functionality.
- Critical- For very serious errors that cause the crash.

It works as when we run our app, the logs messages appear on our console.
Logs make the user understand what is going on with our app without disrupting the users.

-------
# Indexing in the ORM

indexes in ORM are the special database feature that make the searching and retrieving the data faster. Think of them as a table of contents for our database 

Instead of searching through every row index help the database to directly jump to relevant row.

# Why?
Without the index, database scans each and every row  to find what we need.
With an index this process is much faster, as the database quickly locate the data.

Django automatically create indexes for
1. Primary key
2. Field with unique is  true

Custom indexing- 
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)  # Adds an index
db_index= creates an index for the name field.

for indexing in multiple fields we can create composite index.

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['name', 'category']),  # Composite index
        ]


-----

Json (dump, loads) and python dictionary.

JSON stands for Java script object notation, Json are similar to python dictionary but the type of JSON are string whereas the type of python dictionaries are dictionary.
These are used to storing and exchanging the data


# Python Dictionary
data = {"name": "Sanskar", "age": 25, "city": "Kota"}

# Equivalent JSON
json_data = '{"name": "Sanskar", "age": 25, "city": "Kota"}'


- To convert the python dictionary to JSON we use JSON.dump or JSON.dumps.

	Use json.dumps to convert the python dictionary to JSON , and json.dumps to to store the JSON in string format.

	use JSON.dump() you want to writes the JSON data into a file.

- Converting JSON to python dictionary (JSON.load, JSON.loads)
	These methods convert JSON- formatted data into a python dictionary.
	Json.loads() convert a JSON string into a python dictionary.
	Json.load() reads a JSON file and convert it into  a dictionary.


---------
# PM2( process manager ) 

PM2 is a process manager allow us to keep the applications running in the background, restart them on failure and manage the logs.

Key features of the PM2
- keeps application alive.
- support the log management
- start applications on system boot

------
# Crontab

crontab is used for running scheduled tasks in DJango, such as
- Running the database backups
- Sending scheduled emails.
- Clearing expired sessions.

crontab is a job schedular which work on epoch and unix , used to schedule scripts and commands to run at a specific time.

------
# Caching(file based, redis, database )-

Caching is a technique to store the frequently accessed data into temporary storage(or cache) so that future request for the same data will be served faster.

# Why?
Performance- Reduces the databse or the API calls
Scalability- Handles the increased load by serving the cached data
Latency- Faster responses since the data is pre-fetched or compound

# Types of caching

- File based caching 
	Cached data is stored un files or disk.
	
	Use cases:
	- simple applications or local setups.
	- Small datasets that don't require fast access
	Advantages
	- Easy to set up
	- Persistent
	Disadvantages
	- Slow
	- Not suitable for high performance use cases
	
- Redis Caching
	Redis is a high performance in- memory key-value store often use for caching
	 Use cases
		- Real time apps
		- fast read
		- distributed caching
	Advantages-
		Blazing fast speed
		Support data structures like strings hash list sets
		Distributed and scalable
	Disadvantages-
	- Volatile(data may be lost if redis isn't persisted)
	- Requires additional infrastructure
	
- Database caching-
	Use cases
	- When no external cache system is availaible
	- smaller applications where adding in-memory system isn't feasible
	Advantages-
	- No need for additional infrastructure
	- Persistent(data survives restarts)
	Disadvantages-
	- Slower than in-memory
	- Increased load on database
------
# API (Application programming Interface)

Think of API as a waiter i.e it act as a bridge between the client and server, client act as the customer and the server act as the cook in kitchen, so once the client ask for the data API take that request to the cook or the server and brings back the dish(response).

Example- When we visit a weather app. The app request weather data from an API, The API responds with "Today's weather is sunny and the temperature is 30 degrees"

--------
# Authentication

This is about proving who you are.

It is like showing our id to get into a club.
The server act as the security guard that checks your credentials to verify you are allowed to use the API or system.

Example- When we log in to an app we enter our credentials i.e username and password to confirm our identity.

-------
# Authorization

This is about what we are allowed to do .

- After we are inside the club, the bouncer(system) checks whether you can access the VIP are or just the dance floor.

Example- When we log into a system, but can only view your own profile not someone's else's

-----
# How the API handles both?
Authentication- API often use tokens to identify who we are.
Authorization- Once authenticated, the server checks our permissions to decide whether we are authorized to perform a task.

----
# Default Dictionary 

A default dictionary is just a python dictionary but with a twist
like if we try to access a key that doesn't exist in our dictionary it will throw an error, but in case of the default dictionary it return the default value provided.

Without default dictionary we need to write and extra code to handle the exception
With default dictionary, it happens automatically and save the time and effort.

- `defaultdict` saves time by **automatically handling missing keys**.
- The default value is determined by the function you pass (e.g., `int` for `0`, `list` for `[]`).
- It's great for tasks like counting or grouping.

---------

# Settings file components

- BASE_DIR= it its the main directory which contains our project
- secret_key= secret key in django is like a password for our project, which is used to 
	1. Keep our app secure-Django uses it to create hashes for  things like session cookies, password, csrf tokens, etc.
	2. Make hashes unique-Each project's hashes are different because the secret_key is different
- Debug- Debug setting in Django is like a switch that tells Django how much information to show when something goes wrong.
- Debug=True- it returns the complex python errors if there to the user which can overwhelm the user and leak the private information as well.
- ALLOWED_HOSTS=Tell our app that which domain name and IP address are allowerd to host it.
- Middleware- These are the pipeline that processes requests and responses before they reach your app or go back to the user.
	Each malware can perform specific tasks such as processing requests, processing response, Adding security measures and managing sessions.
	There are different types of malwares present in django like security=adds security headers to request and responses, session=Manage sessions for the logged in users, csrf-Protects against the cross site request forgery , Auth= Associate the users with request ,Common= Performs general tasks like url normalisation.
	
	
 Django processes the request from the top to the bottom of this list when it comes in and reverses the order when sending the response back.
 - DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD specifies the type of the primary key field that django uses for our models, if we don't explicitly present one.

-----
# Django modules
- Django.contrib= Collection of pre built apps provided by django, These apps are like plugins that add commonly needed features to our django project.
	- includes apps for things like:
	- Authentication
	- User management
	- Static file handling
	- Admin interface
	- Sessions
- Django.Conf= This provides access to project settings and configuration.


------
# Migrations folder
Migration folder in our django project keep track the changes that are made to our models. It stores mitigation files that describe these changes and allows Django to apply them to your database.

It is used to keep our database schema in sync with our models.py file.
Whenever we make the changes the migration folder record those changes.

------
# Django Auth Forms-
This module provides pre-built forms for the user authentication and management. These forms are specially designed to handle common authentication related task like, logging in, signing in, and changing passwords.

Key forms in the Django.contrib.auth.forms are

1. User Creation Form-
	- Used for registering new users.
	- Automatically includes field like username, password1 and password2.
2. Authentication form:
	- Used for logging in the users.
	- Includes fields like username and password.
	- Automatically handles the authentication using Django's Backend.
3. Password Change form:
	- Used for changing user's password when they are already logged in.
	- Requires the user to enter their old password along with the new one
4. Password reset form:-
	- Sends an email with a password reset link to the user.
5. Set Password form- To set a new password after receiving a reset email.

---------
# Meta class

Metaclass is a class that defines how other classes are created.

- It is responsible for creating class, just like how a normal class is responsible for creating objects.
- When we define a new class, python uses a metaclass to create that class. By default the metaclass used is type.

------

# API 
API stands for application programming interface
It helps apps interacting with each other, for example a front end app like react/angular can send request to the Django app to fetch the data.

# How does API look like

API often use http request and respond with the JSON 
i.e GET/api/products/
Response= [
  {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 50000},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Phone", "price": 30000}
]

# How do we create API?

To build API we use the Django Rest Framework.

Steps
- Install Django Rest Framework.
- Inlist the DRF in the installed App.
- Create a Model 
- Create a serializer(A serializer converts Python objects like model into JSON and vice versa)
- Create a view(view handle the API logic (i.e fetching data and saving the new data )
- Set up URL

# Test your API
- Start the server visit - http----/api/products/(you will see the JSON data foe all the products)

-----
# Understanding the API views in DRF

API views handle the request and response in Django. They determine how data is retrieved, modified and deleted.

# Types of API views.
- function based views- uses @API_view decorator.
- Class based views- uses APIview for more flexibility
- ViewSets- The most powerful method automatically handle CRUD operation.

# Function based views
They are the easiest they use the @api_view decorator to specify allowed HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

------
# Redis

# What is Redis?

- Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Server , it is like a super fast notebook where you can store and look up data quickly.
- Its a database but different from traditional ones.
- Redis store the data in memory (RAM) instead of disk, this makes it really fast.

# Why is Redis fast?
Because traditional database store the data in disk while the redis store the data in memory.
so fetching and saving is very fast.

# What can redis store?
Redis is called a key-value store which means
Key: A unique identifier(like nametag)
Value: The actual data you want to save(a number, string, list, etc)

It supports different types of data like.
- Strings
- Lists
- hashes
- set
- sorted sets
- Bitmaps, streams and more.

# What is redis used for?
Redis is your helper for making things fast.
1. Caching- Store frequently accessed data so apps don't have to keep recalculating(user sessions or recent searches )
2. Real time data- perfect for things like leaderboard, chat apps or live updates
3. queues- Managing tasks (like sending emails, 'process files' )
4. pub/sub messaging- real time notifications. one part can send the message and others can listen and respond.


# Redis in Django

Caching- speed up our app by storing results of the expensive operations(eg, database, queries).

Sessions- Store user session data in Redis instead of the database or file system.

Task Queues- Use Redis with tools like celery to handle background tasks.

# Steps to use the redis with Django

1. Install Redis and Required Libraries
2. Then, install Python library to connect Django with redis
3. Configure Django to use redis
	1. For caching - Add the redis in settings.py
	2. For sessions- Use Redis to store session data, now when users log in,their session data is stored in Redis, making it faster and more scalable.
	3. For background Tasks- Use Celery with redis as the message broker.
